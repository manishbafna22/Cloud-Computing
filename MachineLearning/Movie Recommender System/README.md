**Movie Recomender System**:

Recommender System is an information filtering tool that seeks to predict which product a user will like, and based on that, recommends a few products to the users.
For example, Amazon can recommend new shopping items to buy, Netflix can recommend new movies to watch, and Google can recommend news that a user might be interested in. The two widely used approaches for building a recommender system are content-based filtering (CBF) and collaborative filtering (CF).
